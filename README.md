# MITNft Contract

The MITNft contract is a sample smart contract written in Solidity that represents a non-fungible token (NFT) called "MitAvatar". The contract is based on the ERC721 standard and extends the ERC721 and Ownable contracts from the OpenZeppelin library.

## Overview

The purpose of the MITNft contract is to mint and manage MITAvatars, which are unique digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows the owner to mint a single MITAvatar with a token ID of 1.

## Deployment
**This project was deployed using hardhat, so it also demonstrates a Hardhat use case. It comes with the contracts and the scripts that deploys the contracts.**
This contract is deployed to on the Sepolia testnet at **0xa8A957ef63C4937e61557c3a116dDF3dFcbC9635**. And can be seen on Opensea [here](https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/sepolia/0xa8a957ef63c4937e61557c3a116ddf3dfcbc9635/1).
